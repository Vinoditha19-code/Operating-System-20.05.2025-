01. If-Else Statement
Program Task: Check if user is eligible for election voting.
Conclusion:
This example uses basic decision-making with if-else.
If the age is 18 or more, the person is eligible to vote.
This is useful in scenarios requiring conditional validation (e.g., form input, access control).

02. Ternary Operator
Syntax Summary: condition ? expr1 : expr2;
Conclusion:
A short-hand for simple if-else statements.
Useful for small checks like assigning values or printing based on condition.

03. Switch Case (Example 1 – Days of the Week)
Conclusion:
Switch is ideal when you have fixed choices (like menu options, days, grades).
break is important to prevent fall-through.
Always include a default case for handling invalid inputs.

04.Switch Case (Example 2 – Life Path Number)
Conclusion:
Demonstrates switch-case with arithmetic logic.
You calculate a life path number and map it to a meaning.
Shows how multiple logics (arithmetic + decision making) can be combined.

05. For Loop (Example 3 – Sum and Product)
Conclusion:
Shows basic iteration with accumulation (sum/product).
Useful when working with lists, arrays, or repetitive tasks.

06. While Loop (Example 4 – Print 1 to 10)
Conclusion:
Introduces while loop (entry-controlled loop).
Good when number of iterations is known or condition-based.

07.Fibonacci Series (Example 5)
Conclusion:
A common programming pattern.
Shows loop, variable updates, and logic in sequence.
Useful for understanding sequence generation.

08.Factorial Calculation (Example 6)
Conclusion:
Important for understanding recursion or loops.
Used in combinations, permutations, and mathematical logic.

09.String Concatenation (Example 7)
Conclusion:
Introduces strings and string operations in C (fgets, strcat).
Essential for text processing.
Note: fgets() is safer than gets().

10.Binary to Decimal (Example 8)
Conclusion:
Demonstrates numeric base conversion.
Good use of loops and arithmetic operations.
Useful in digital systems, networking, or any binary data handling.

11.Max and Min in Array (Example 9)
Conclusion:
Shows array processing and condition checking.
Useful in sorting, searching, statistics (finding range, outliers).

12.Pascal’s Triangle (Example 10)
Conclusion:
Combines loops, mathematical functions, and formatting.
Helps understand combinations, symmetry, and number patterns.
Also great for logic building and nested loops.
